\section{EXPERIENCE}

{\customcventry{Sept 2018 - Present}{Subsystem Head - Autonomous}{Team Astra Robotics}{Bengaluru, KA}{}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed an interface to control a robot over a local network using a simple PS4 controller connected to the base station computer
  \item Developed a user interface to analyse various values of a rover as it traversed the field in the competition IRC 2020
  \item Wrote bash and python scripts to autonomously control the rover with an initial signal as per IRC 2020 rules
  \item Developed various robots using many open source boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi by integrating computer vision for autonomous decisions
\end{itemize}}}

{\customcventry{June 2019 - Sept 2019}{Research Intern}{Centre for Society and Policy, Indian Institute of Science}{Bengaluru, KA}{}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a simple user interface using iPython to analyse various dependency results on  the provided dataset to draw inferences
  \item Analysed given data using various machine learning metrics to predict future outcomes according to the data collected
  \item Contributed to research by analysing survey data which was collected for a research project aimed towards saving the cauvery river basin in Kodagu district, Karnataka

\section{PROJECTS}

{\customcvproject{Implementation of GANs in HPCC Systems using GNN Bundle}{Jan - July, 2020}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed an interface to use various GAN models on HPCC Systems, a distributed computing cluster for increased speed in training of the models
  \item Designed a module on the HPCC Systems for users to conveniently use GAN without building the architecture for it
  \item Added a support module to the GNN bundle to convert images into tensors in the language ECL for convenience of users in training neural networks with image data
  \item Designed an architecture for GANs to run on HPCC Systems by understanding the working of GANs
\end{itemize}
